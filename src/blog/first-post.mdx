# Mastering Markdown: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the ultimate guide to Markdown! Whether you're a beginner just starting or a seasoned pro looking for a refresher, this post will cover every feature of Markdown. Let's dive in and see what this powerful and simple language can do.

---

## The Basics: Text Formatting

Let's start with the fundamentals. You can easily make your text **bold**, _italic_, or even **_bold and italic_**. If you need to cross something out, you can use ~~strikethrough~~.

- **Bold Text:** `**Bold Text**`
- _Italic Text:_ `*Italic Text*`
- **_Bold & Italic:_** `***Bold & Italic***`
- ~~Strikethrough:~~ `~~Strikethrough~~`

## Headings: Structuring Your Content

Markdown supports six levels of headings. You've already seen `H1` at the top of this post. Here are the others:

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Blockquotes: Quoting Others

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting a quote or a note.
>
> You can even have multiple paragraphs within the same blockquote. Just add a `>` before each line.
>
> > You can also nest blockquotes.
> >
> > How cool is that?

## Lists: Ordered and Unordered

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested Item 2a
    - Deeper nested item
  - Nested Item 2b
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Nested first item
   2. Nested second item

## Code: Inline and Blocks

You can format code inline, like `const greeting = "Hello, World!";`, right in the middle of a sentence.

For larger code snippets, use fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// A simple JavaScript function
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Markdown User"));
```

```python
# A simple Python function
def greet(name):
  return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Markdown User"))
```

## Horizontal Rule

You can create a horizontal rule to separate sections, like the one below, by using three or more asterisks, dashes, or underscores.

---

## Links: Connecting to the Web

You can create an inline link, like this one to the [Telfer Business Technology Association](https://www.telferbta.com), or you can use a reference-style link.

This is a [reference-style link][1]. You can define the URL at the bottom of your document, which can make your source text easier to read. You can also use a link to another part of this document, like this one to the [Tables](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23tables-organizing-data) section.

---

## Images: Adding Visuals

You can embed an image just as easily as a link, with a preceding `!`.

You can also combine images with links:

| ----------------- | :----------- | :---------------------- | :-------: |
| **Bold**          | `**text**`   | **Bold Text**           |  Center   |
| _Italic_          | `*text*`     | _Italic Text_           |   Right   |
| `Code`            | `` `code` `` | `console.log('Hello');` |   Left    |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | `~~text~~`   | ~~Mistake~~             |  Center   |
